> This is Major Tom to Ground Control  
I'm stepping through the door  
And I'm floating  
in a most peculiar way  
And the stars look very different today

# Major Tom 
He's floating far above the Moon, so you might as well ask him what's going on up there.

Major Tom is a bot for Slack that lets you see satellites orbiting the Earth on a map.
~~He will also remind you when the ISS is visible from your location 🛰👩‍🚀👨‍🚀~~.

For now you can track the [International Space Station (ISS)](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) with the Slack slash command `/iss`.
